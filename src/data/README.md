# Data loaders

Instead of directly writing files without knowing its provenance, data loaders let you write a file (with extension indicating both the programming language and the output type) that is run during build. Data loaders generate static snapshots of data during build, which can be furthered queried and transformed using duckDB. All data loaders conclude by printing to the console, which is a convenient way to work in different languages. As an aside, we call directly the data from the original source using `request` in python, so that we always know where it is coming from. If the request fails during a new build, at least we know (and there is a copy of the file that is cached, meaninf the website will still be functional).
