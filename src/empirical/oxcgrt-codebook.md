# OxCGRt - codebook
## Taken from [documentation_and_codebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-dataset/main/documentation_and_codebook.md)

The indicators are of four types:
- **Ordinal**: These indicators measure policies on a simple scale of severity / intensity. These indicators are reported for each day a policy is in place.
  - Many have a further flag to note if they are “targeted”, applying only to a sub-region of a jurisdiction, or a specific sector; or “general”, applying throughout that jurisdiction or across the economy. (Note, the flag for indicators `E1` and `H7` means something different.)
- **Numeric**: These indicators measure a specific number, typically the value in USD. These indicators are only reported on the day they are announced.
- **Text**: This is a “free response” indicator that records other information of interest.
- **Categorical**: These indicators have a range of eligible categories to select, and in some instances, rank (i.e. vaccine prioritisation/eligibility policies).
- **Binary**: This measures the presence (1) or absence (0) of a requirement to be vaccinated for certain groups

All observations also have a “notes” cell that reports sources and comments to justify and substantiate the designation.

## V - vaccination policies
--[return to top](#)-- <br/>
--[return to start of codebook](#codebook-and-interpretation-guidance)--

The four V indicators focus on 53 different population groups – by occupation, risk status, and age group.

***V1 – Vaccine prioritisation*** is a categorical indicator that captures eligible and prioritised groups of people (e.g. profession, age, vulnerability, etc.), and shows the order in which these groups are prioritised for vaccines by their country/region/territory. ***V2 – Vaccine eligibility/availability*** (also a categorical indicator) is linked to V1, and indicates which of the prioritised groups are actually being vaccinated at that time. ***V3 – Vaccine financial support*** captures information on whether vaccines are government funded, or otherwise. ***V4- Mandatory Vaccination*** is a binary indicator which reports the existence of a requirement to be vaccinated for a group of people.

This means that each of the V indicators are actually reported as 53 different variables. We also summarise these into 10 summary indicators: `V1`, `V2A`, `V2B`, `V2C`, `V2D`, `V2E`, `V2F`, `V2G`, `V3`, and `V4`.

Most of the data under our vaccine indicators are directly recorded by OxCGRT data collectors. These variables are:

## General interpretation guidance
--[return to top](#)-- <br/>
--[return to start of codebook](#codebook-and-interpretation-guidance)--

There are a few general rules that apply to our data:

 - **We report the most stringent government policy** with the highest ordinal value. If the most stringent policy is only present in a limited geographic area or sector, we use a binary flag variable for most indicators to describe this scope and reflect whether the policy is targeted or general.
- **Implementation not announcement:** We start coding a policy from the day the policy was implemented in practice, not the day it was announced (except for `V1`, where the policy being recorded is the announced prioritisation list, not the actual availability of vaccines).
 - **If coding a country with a contested government or multiple ruling parties**, we try to code the “dominant tendency” in the jurisdiction, which generally means recording the policies of the more formalised government, or the one which governs the larger proportion of the population
 - **Where testing/vaccination exemptions are in place we still report this as a closure**. Some governments implement restrictions where citizens can gain exemption through evidence of testing or vaccination. We deal with this primarily through our differentiated coding (see more below). But the general rule is that – apart from differentiated coding – we still report the more stringent government policy that applies to people who do not obtain an exemption. The only time we would report the more open policy is if anyone can arrive and get tested onsite with a rapid test to gain entry. We would not code this as a required closure, as anyone can ‘test out’ of restrictions easily. Such at-the-door testing must apply to all sectors within the indicator, and be a government policy, not that of a private business.

## Subnational data and the `jurisdiction` variable
--[return to top](#)-- <br/>
--[return to start of codebook](#codebook-and-interpretation-guidance)--

OxCGRT includes data for nearly all national-level countries, territories, and regions in the world. It also includes subnational-level data for Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America (as well as partial data for Italian regions).

OxCGRT data are used in different ways – for instance some people may want to know the policies that apply to all residents in a state, while others may want to know the policies adopted by that state government (as opposed to the national government). To distinguish between these uses, different published versions of OxCGRT data are tagged in the database using the `jurisdiction` variable.

The `jurisdiction` variable is composed of two parts: the first part specifies the level of government (ie. `NAT`, `STATE`, or `CITY`) and the second part of the variable describes type of data (ie. `TOTAL`, `WIDE`, or `GOV`), which we will describe next.

- The jurisdiction label `TOTAL` simply represents the total package of policies that apply to a resident in that jurisdiction, regardless of which level of government set the policy. This seems to be the most common use case for OxCGRT data. For example, observations labelled `AUS_NSW STATE_TOTAL` describe the policies that apply to people in the state of New South Wales, regardless of whether the policy comes from the state government, the federal Australian government, or even the city of Sydney.
- The jurisdiction label `GOV` indicates that observations include only policies instigated by a particular level of government; higher- or lower-level jurisdictions do not inform the coding of these observations.
- The jurisdiction label `WIDE` refers to policies put in place at a given level of government as well as any policies from lower levels of government. `WIDE` observations therefore do not incorporate general policies from higher levels of government that may supersede local policies. Continuing to examine the case of New South Wales, the data recorded for `AUS_NSW STATE_WIDE` would include any policies made by the state government of New South Wales in Australia plus policies from municipal governments (eg. cities) within New South Wales, but not policies from the Australian federal government. For example, if a country has an international travel restriction (indicator `C8`) set by the national government, we would report this policy in our `STATE_TOTAL` data but not `STATE_WIDE` data.

Note that `CITY_GOV` and `NAT_WIDE` are not used, since these are functionally equivalent to `CITY_WIDE` and `NAT_TOTAL`, given that we do not consider units below city level or above national level.
